							<p>You heard of 3D printing from newscasters and journalists,
								astonished at what they’ve witnessed. A machine reminiscent of
								the Star Trek Replicator, something magical that can create
								objects out of thin air. It can “print” in plastic, metal,
								nylon, and over a hundred other materials. It can be used for
								making nonsensical little models like the over-printed Yoda, yet
								it can also print manufacturing prototypes, end user products,
								quasi-legal guns, aircraft engine parts and even human organs
								using a person’s own cells. Fantastical? Yes. True? Yes. Here
								now? Yes. We live in an age that is witness to what many are
								calling the Third Industrial Revolution. 3D printing, more
								professionally called additive manufacturing, moves us away from
								the Henry Ford era mass production line, and will bring us to a
								new reality of customizable, one-off production. Need a part for
								your washing machine? As it is now, you’d order from your
								repairman who gets it from a distributor, who got it shipped
								from China, where they mass-produced thousands of them at once,
								probably injection-molded from a very expensive mold. In the
								future, the beginning of which is already here now, you will
								simply 3D print the part right in your home, from a CAD file you
								downloaded. If you don’t have the right printer, just print it
								at your local fab (think Kinkos). 3D printers use a variety of
								very different types of additive manufacturing technologies, but
								they all share one core thing in common: they create a three
								dimensional object by building it layer by successive layer,
								until the entire object is complete. It’s much like printing in
								two dimensions on a sheet of paper, but with an added third
								dimension: UP. The Z-axis. Each of these printed layers is a
								thinly-sliced, horizontal cross-section of the eventual object.
								Imagine a multi-layer cake, with the baker laying down each
								layer one at a time until the entire cake is formed. 3D printing
								is somewhat similar, but just a bit more precise than 3D baking.

								Stick with us and we’ll go through the various types of additive
								manufacturing. From FDM printing, where a material is melted and
								extruded in layers, one upon the other, to SLS printing, where a
								bed of powder material such as nylon or titanium is “sintered”
								(hardened) layer upon thin layer within it until a model is
								pulled out of it. It’s a fascinating and quickly advancing world
								that will change our lives as we know it.
